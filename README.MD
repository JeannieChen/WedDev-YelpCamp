# YelpCamp
Yelpcamp is a campground rating app, where users can create their own campgrounds, view and comment on others' campgrounds. It is the final project for my web developer bootcamp course taught by Colt Steele on Udemy.

Feature includes:
- Sign up or login to add new campground/comment/like. Flash message has been added to give warning.
- Check campground/comment's ownership to prevent malicious edit/deletion
- Optional admin signin option to assign access of editing all camps/comment
- Public user profile page
- Fuzzy search for campgrounds on home page
- Display time since post was created with Moment JS

This app is deployed at https://guarded-river-63367.herokuapp.com/campgrounds.
